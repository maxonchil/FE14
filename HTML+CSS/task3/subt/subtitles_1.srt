1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.240
If there's one thing I hear patients say

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:05,611
even more than "save my life,"

3
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,103
it's this...

4
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,174
"I want to go home."

5
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:11,756
It's weird spending all of your time

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,695
in a place that most people hate.

7
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:18,209
_

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,858
You're back.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,088
Hey. You're back.

10
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:25,067
Are you still drunk?

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,386
No.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,192
Are you nervous?

13
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,755
No. Are you?

14
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,838
I was, but I snuck in
and did two lap choles

15
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:33,054
before breakfast, so...

16
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,130
_

17
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,445
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

18
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:39,771
Have either one of you seen
a package at the house?

19
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:40,894
What package?

20
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,387
Well, Cristina was sending something...

21
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,401
you know, "Congratulations
on not becoming a drifter

22
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:46,380
slash getting dumped
by a resident" present...

23
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,046
but I don't know where it is.

24
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,212
Ooh. Maybe it's a stripper.

25
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:51,646
What is wrong with you?

26
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,279
Sorry. Hormones.

27
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,084
Well, knowing her, it's a cadaver.

28
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:56,820
But this hospital, in particular...

29
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,556
Welcome back, Dr. Grey!

30
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,049
...it's where I grew up.

31
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,855
It's where my fondest memories happened.

32
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:02,966
This is the best day of my life.

33
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,286
Mine, too, Helm.

34
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,230
Bailey re-hired you?

35
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:07,827
Well, I was gonna tell you,

36
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,154
but you were too busy dumping me.

37
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:12,946
I did not dump you.
I asked you to take some time.

38
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,450
Rob/steal. Murder/kill.

39
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,943
It all means the same thing.

40
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:16,985
It's home.

41
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,686
Thanks.

42
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,584
Get your residents together.
Time for rounds.

43
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:22,888
Even if it's a broken home.

Wendy Bliss to Urology.

47
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,404
You still need to eat.

48
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,227
How you holding up?

49
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,162
I'm still standing.

50
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,794
You talk to Maggie?

51
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,009
Gemma.

52
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,788
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to ask.

53
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:52,554
Just be easy on her, okay?

54
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:57,899
Who was that?

55
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,045
A friend.

56
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,799
Hi.

57
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,229
I'm looking for Chief Karev.

58
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,626
Uh, Karev's on a personal day.
Can I help you?

59
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,611
I'm Dr. Daphne Lopez.
I'm here for a walk-through.

60
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:12,897
Oh, oh. Right, right. Yeah.

61
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,285
Karev said that you were coming.

62
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:16,368
You're the ER doc from UCLA?

63
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,584
Yep. That's me.

64
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:19,285
- Well, and good to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:21,289
I'm Owen Hunt, and this is
Dr. Richard Webber.

66
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,758
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

67
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:25,328
Um, Karev said that
we're trying to woo you

68
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,099
to see if we can get you

69
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:28,557
to come over here
instead of Seattle Pres.

70
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,710
Well, I'll tell you a secret...
you're winning.

71
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,411
They can't afford me.

72
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,523
You really should start

73
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:39,634
bringing all your patients
here, you know?

74
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:41,370
Oh, yeah? "Sorry, sir.

75
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,933
I know you're having
a heart attack right now,

76
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,086
but my dude works across town
at Grey-Sloan, so..."

77
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,266
- Yeah.
- "...we got to go."

78
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,211
- He'll understand.
- Yeah?

79
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,085
- What time does your shift end tonight?
- Tomorrow morning.

80
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,440
Well, maybe I'll show up
at the fire station

81
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,147
- with an emergency.
- Jackson.

82
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,449
And then I'll be
at the hospital across town.

83
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,953
Hey, Ma.

84
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:58,464
Mom, I did not know
you were back in town.

85
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,818
New ride?

86
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:03,151
Well, apparently limos
can be death traps.

87
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,894
Oh, yeah. I've seen them take
out entire wedding parties.

88
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,596
And, uh, this is...?

89
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,853
I'm... I'm Victoria Hughes, ma'am.

90
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:12,895
Station 19.

91
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,458
Station 19? What is that?

92
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,194
A TV channel?

93
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,277
No, ma'am. It's a... It's a fire station.

94
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,353
Mm.

95
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:22,460
Well, I...

96
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,710
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

97
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,071
- Mm.
- Sorry.

98
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:28,398
Sorry.

99
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:34,926
You lean into all paramedics like that?

100
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,106
Huh.

101
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,492
I like the hormones.

102
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,603
Hormones are good.

103
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,782
You're better.

104
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,345
- You have rounds.
- Oh, I can't.

105
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,942
I don't want to. Ah, just go.

106
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,470
Face them. I'll reward you later.

107
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:01,075
They are so mean.

108
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,984
I want my reward now.

109
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,399
No. Go.

110
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:10,497
- Levi, be great, okay?
- Oh.

111
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:11,851
Go prove them wrong.

112
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,491
Okay. I'll play.

113
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,025
I hope our baby has...

114
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,831
your eyes and my nose.

115
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:29,420
I hope our baby has
my hair and your brain.

116
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:30,740
Ooh. I don't know.

117
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:33,173
I'm not sure I want
this amygdala in our baby.

118
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,816
Maybe my basal ganglia?

119
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,726
Jo, do you think
that our baby should have

120
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,639
my prefrontal cortex or Link's?

121
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,055
What?

122
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,508
Are you okay?

123
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,105
Yeah. I, uh...

124
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,161
I signed up to be a Safe Haven volunteer,

125
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,800
which means that, when a baby
is dropped off at a fire station

126
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:51,262
in the vicinity, they call me, and...

127
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,339
they just called me.

128
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:54,006
- Whoa.
- Shepherd.

129
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,923
Dr. Brooks to Oncology.
Dr. Brooks to Oncology.

130
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,485
How's your resting heart rate?

131
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,978
Oh. Um...

132
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,437
up 15%.

133
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,954
- Is that weird?
- No. Normal.

134
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,737
- Blood pressure?
- Down.

135
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,507
Ooh, this is fun.
It's like we're in a club.

136
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,034
See you.

137
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,118
Which therapist told you to do this?

138
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,549
Carly. But she...
she didn't tell me to do it.

139
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,339
She told me that she did it.

140
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,227
And how is that helpful?

141
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,484
Well, hearing her story
made me feel better...

142
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:19,562
and I don't know...

143
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,430
it just sounded nice... helping someone.

144
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,627
You sure it's not too much too soon?

145
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:26,305
Can you come with me?

146
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,867
Alex went to Iowa to help his mom.

147
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,152
I have a surgery.

148
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,355
Ugh.

149
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,519
I can cancel?

150
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,506
No. No. No. It's... I'm... It's good.

151
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:36,628
Are you sure?

152
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,086
Yeah. No. I'm fine.

153
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:45,656
Ooh, cake.

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,991
None for you, traitor.

155
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,399
I didn't mean to rat out Grey,
and you all know that.

156
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,752
I was just doing my job.

157
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,176
Mm-hmm. That's what the Nazis said.

158
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,163
Okay, my great-grandfather
was in a concentration camp,

159
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,566
so that's really not cool to say.

160
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,382
Apologize to the traitor.

161
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,598
Sorry, traitor.

162
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:01,507
Excuse me. Coming through.

163
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,695
Excuse me.

164
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,876
Look, Grey's back, all right?

165
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,449
So you can all shut up about it now.

166
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:10,327
- Hi, Elliott. Finley?
- Hi.

167
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:11,835
Wheelchair? What happened?

168
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,027
- Jasper happened.
- Jasper.

169
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,867
4 pounds, 14 ounces.

170
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:15,978
Wow. You had the baby!

171
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,089
I thought he wasn't due
for another month.

172
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,790
- Oh, he wasn't.
- No, but he's okay.

173
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,596
- He's in the NICU.
- Yeah.

174
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,638
Oh, yeah, show her, show her.

175
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,076
Check out this little alien.

176
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:24,060
Aww.

177
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,102
- Yeah.
- Isn't he cute?

178
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,769
We're calling him "E.T." for short.

179
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,852
Yeah, I was in the middle
of my usual pre-surgery fast

180
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:29,894
when her water broke.

181
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,081
He wanted to postpone,
and I was like, "No.

182
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:33,643
You don't postpone heart surgery."

183
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,934
Yeah. Jasper's immune system's
still a little wonky.

184
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,224
They're not letting me hold him
until I get discharged.

185
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,189
Schmitt, present, please.

186
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:43,134
Elliott Calhoun, 39,

187
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,321
here for a fourth
aortic valve replacement

188
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,784
due to congenital aortic stenosis.

189
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,115
Okay, 64-year-old male.

190
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,366
In remission for over a year

191
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,136
after being treated for mesothelioma.

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,393
Primary complaints
are night sweats, weight loss,

193
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,055
and an inguinal and testicular mass.

194
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,420
Lymphoma.

195
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:59,157
It's a little early to jump
to that conclusion, Simms.

196
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,691
Pretty solid conclusion to jump to.

197
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,830
Uh, you all
can go on to the next patient.

198
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:07,998
I've got this.

199
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:13,200
Dr. Bailey.

200
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,074
Captain Herrera.

201
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:17,978
I'm so sorry to see you back here.

202
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,806
Please don't tell your husband
my cancer's back.

203
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,611
Okay, first, we don't know that,

204
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:27,013
and of course I won't say a word.

205
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,456
Good morning, good morning.

206
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:34,569
- Good morning. Hi.
- Hi.

207
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,861
- Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.

208
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,441
Dr. DeLuca.

209
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,372
- Jamie Caldwell... 13.
- Jamie.

210
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,907
I know Jamie. I took out your
gallbladder two years ago.

211
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,131
How are we doing?

212
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:47,528
Zachary just commented on Tessa's photo

213
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,786
with a heart emoji. When I'm dying.

214
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:51,904
You're not dying. She's not dying. Right?

215
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,614
Jamie presents with a palpable
3 by centimeter mass

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,594
in between her ribs
on her right side, which...

217
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,637
- Hurts like hell.
- Yeah.

218
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:58,728
Language.

219
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,952
Can you cut this thing off
before Tessa's bat mitzvah?

220
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:04,252
Zachary Schultz isn't gonna
dance with a hunchback.

221
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,067
Who's presenting?

222
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,471
There a problem?

223
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,419
W-We already started.

224
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:16,664
Hi. Who are you?

225
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,825
Cormac Hayes, chief of pediatric surgery.

226
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,972
Since when?

227
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,402
Since this morning.

228
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,039
For the future,
let's not round on my patients

229
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,759
when I'm not here.

230
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,215
Start again.

231
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,301
Jamie Caldwell, 13,
presents with persistent back pain...

232
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:36,199
Hey, Alex. I'm at the fire station.

233
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,075
I'll explain later, but call me.

234
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,429
And say "hi" to your mom.

235
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,506
Bye.

236
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:00,668
- Hey.
- Hi.

237
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:05,086
Um... there was a-a baby
dropped off here?

238
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,081
Oh. Yeah, okay.

239
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,617
So, uh, if you change your mind,

240
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:11,458
according to law, you have 72 hours to...

241
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,918
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,471
No. I'm not the mother.
I'm the Safe Haven thingy.

243
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,244
I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm Victoria Hughes.

244
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,460
Thanks for coming.

245
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:20,984
Oh, yeah, Vic.
Um, you're Jackson's girlfriend.

246
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,409
Girlf... Girlfriend?

247
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,799
Well, no. No labels.

248
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,084
But, um, did he say something?

249
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:26,769
Did... You know what? Never mind.

250
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,526
Um, sorry. Who are you?

251
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,795
- I...
- Uh, that would be Jo Karev.

252
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,150
Hi.

253
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,644
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:36,562
- Hi. Oh, wow.
- Oh.

255
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,091
That's a brand-new baby.

256
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,897
Yep. Fresh out the oven.

257
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,460
We're guessing three days old.

258
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:44,344
Engine requested to 368 Great Marsh Road.

259
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,461
That would be Mrs. Wiinikainen again.

260
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,264
What else does she have to burn down?

261
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,018
Um, Mrs. Wiinikainen
tends to light things on fire

262
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,233
when she gets lonely.

263
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,865
- Oof. Dark.
- Come on, guys. We got a call.

264
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,878
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

265
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,214
Oh, my goodness.

266
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:01,360
Come on. Let me show you around.

267
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,721
Okay.

268
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,159
So, I have a valve replacement

269
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:09,271
on a chronic aortic stenosis.

270
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:10,289
You want to scrub in?

271
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,469
Okay.

272
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:13,171
- Why?
- Hmm?

273
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,767
Why do you need me to scrub in
on a valve replacement?

274
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,411
No, I don't. I don't. I just...

275
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:18,487
thought it would be fun.

276
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,431
Okay, but it's a valve replacement,

277
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:23,014
which I'm pretty sure you can do
with your eyes closed.

278
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,726
Okay, well, if you don't want to help...

279
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,115
No. I do. I do.

280
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,845
God, I haven't seen a heart that
isn't traumatized in months.

281
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,787
- Too real.
- Okay.

282
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,811
It feels hard... almost like a bone.

283
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,062
Have we ordered a CT?

284
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:42,834
I was about to,
but then I got interrupted.

285
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,633
Jamie, I'm gonna get some scans

286
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,613
so we can get a better idea
of what's causing your pain

287
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,111
- and the, um...
- Zit-hump?

288
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:49,327
Right. That.

289
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,597
Okay, Parker. Let's get her up to CT.

290
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:52,870
Like I said.

291
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,042
Happy first day.

292
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,093
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

293
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,885
We'll see you soon, Jamie.

294
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,363
Oh, how's the baby?

295
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:10,822
How are you feeling?

296
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,559
Oh, we're both good.

297
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,229
But she's acting up today, though.

298
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,075
Oh. She?

299
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,356
Just a hunch.

300
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,903
Uh, I'll find out for sure later today.

301
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,273
- Okay, you ready?
- No.

302
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:24,464
Fine.

303
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,667
Okay.

304
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,093
Oh.

305
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,051
That's a mass, isn't it?

306
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,385
We won't know if it's malignant
until we get a biopsy,

307
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,712
so let's not write any letters home yet.

308
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,187
With my history,

309
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,376
with the statistics
about firefighters and cancer?

310
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,356
No offense, but it doesn't
take a medical degree

311
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,734
to put that together.

312
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,651
No, but it does take a medical degree

313
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:55,256
to rule out all options before panicking.

314
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,896
So, I am going to get a biopsy.

315
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,737
We'll go from there, okay?

316
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,802
So?

317
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:22,720
Guess that caught you by surprise.

318
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:25,637
My son sneaking around with
another woman in plain sight?

319
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,005
What? No. Nobody's sneaking, okay?

320
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,678
I... broke up with Maggie
months ago. There's no sneaking.

321
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:32,800
I would have told you all of this,

322
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:33,981
but you're traveling so much,

323
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,307
I didn't want to do that
on a text message.

324
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,662
And I promise, this is not gonna affect

325
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:38,749
your marriage to Richard.

326
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:41,593
I'm not sure how much longer
you have to worry about that.

327
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,513
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,986
Richard is working with someone

329
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,702
that he may or may not have
a romantic past with.

330
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,300
So, kind of like you and Koracick?

331
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,384
- That is different.
- How?

332
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,067
Because I don't have a history
of cheating on my spouse.

333
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,214
Oh, Mom. Come on.

334
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,812
Richard would lie down
in traffic for you,

335
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:00,931
- and you know it.
- I might ask him to.

336
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,122
Mom.

337
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,206
Sometimes, when you get
an idea in your head

338
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,729
that you don't like, you retreat.

339
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,439
I do it, too.

340
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,524
We've just...

341
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,094
barely spoken in weeks.

342
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,345
Have you barely spoken,

343
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,707
or you just don't want to listen?

344
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,369
If I've learned anything,

345
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,224
it's don't be a hero.

346
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,540
Use formula when you need formula.

347
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:30,977
Oh, trust me, I'm all over that.

348
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:34,589
Breast is best, but, sometimes,
Mommy needs wine.

349
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,431
Okay, one more deep breath for me.

350
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,868
Okay. We're ready to prep you, Elliott.

351
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,570
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

352
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:44,926
I'm gonna go watch bad TV

353
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,287
and eat pudding and ice my lady parts.

354
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:48,411
Ooh-la-la.

355
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,739
Enjoy it, 'cause it's
gonna be your last alone time

356
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,198
for the next 18 years.

357
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,611
I don't have to be scared, right?

358
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,214
If I die, don't ever leave him
with my mother for the weekend.

359
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,891
Shut up.

360
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,116
And I won't.

361
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,669
We're gonna fix you up so you
can hold that beautiful boy.

362
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,587
- Hey.
- Huh?

363
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,796
Not my usual spot for a meeting,

364
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,844
but this will do.

365
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:25,490
How are you feeling, really?

366
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,184
Well, between losing Sabrina

367
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,316
and things with Catherine, um...

368
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,605
I don't know.

369
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:36,914
Loss is hard enough
without suffering it alone.

370
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:38,442
When my husband died, I was...

371
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,663
I didn't know you were ever married.

372
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,996
Oh, I don't talk about it that much.

373
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,358
We married young.

374
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,163
He died young.

375
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,656
I was a widow young.

376
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:54,502
That's when I started to drink.

377
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,380
Come on. Let's pray.

378
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,976
Okay.

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,330
Hi, Dr. Webber.

380
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:05,073
Um, Dr. Roth paged me
to do a Dobhoff tube,

381
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:07,434
but I have a very serious gag reflex,

382
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,738
- so I was wondering...
- Um, just do your job, Perez.

383
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,312
Got it. Thank you, sir.

384
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:14,399
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Webber.

385
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:16,374
Oh.

386
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,847
Come on, now.

387
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:23,874
God...

388
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,061
...grant me the serenity...

389
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:29,312
to accept the things I cannot change.

390
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:38,575
Hey. Hi.

391
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,582
Hey.

392
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,937
Do you need anything?

393
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:42,395
Oh, uh, no.

394
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:46,554
Um, Ben is grabbing a bottle
for him, so I just...

395
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,413
God, I don't know.

396
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,873
This is just so surreal.

397
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:52,928
Yeah. Yeah, babies freak me out, too.

398
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,365
Oh, no. Um, this... this baby is me.

399
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,108
I was, uh, abandoned
at a fire station by my mom

400
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,405
when I was 5 days old.

401
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,014
Right. So, you know, it's...

402
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,027
seems perfectly natural and healthy

403
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,520
that you would volunteer for this, then.

404
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,256
What?

405
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,744
Well, it made sense at the time.

406
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,874
So, you grew up in the system?

407
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,124
Yeah.

408
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,909
Me too.

409
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,996
Huh.

410
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,177
Did you have any good parents?

411
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:18,739
All crap.

412
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,927
You?

413
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,628
I had one good family.

414
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,456
It only lasted about a year, though.

415
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,732
But now I got these fools,

416
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:29,191
so all of it worked out in the end.

417
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:34,146
So, um... how often does this happen?

418
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,726
We only get like seven a year.

419
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,803
In the whole city.

420
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:40,095
Only seven abandoned babies?

421
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:42,004
Wow. What a freaking blessing.

422
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,053
We don't like to use
the word "abandoned."

423
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:46,275
I mean, they're, uh, they're surrendered.

424
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,769
By people who decided
they weren't fit to parent.

425
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,169
We try not to judge.

426
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,322
But sometimes, we do.

427
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,599
Look, Jo, you know...

428
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:00,759
no one's ever happy
about surrendering a baby,

429
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:03,895
but at least they know that
we'll keep the baby safe.

430
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:06,551
Hey, you, uh... you want to feed him?

431
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:09,496
- Okay.
- Yeah.

432
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,545
Oh, my gosh. Wow. Look at you.

433
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:23,709
You can't hate me forever.

434
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,210
I know I screwed all of us
by getting Meredith Grey fired,

435
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,536
but I was just trying not
to get myself fired.

436
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,821
I made a mistake,

437
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,777
and I thought you, of all
people, would understand that.

438
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,212
Why me of all people?

439
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:34,566
Because you mess up, too.

440
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,511
You're just better
at covering your ass than I am.

441
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:37,795
Hey, guys?

442
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,288
Uh, if I don't make it
through this surgery,

443
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,372
I'm gonna be really bummed
if this fight of yours

444
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:42,621
is the last thing I hear.

445
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,185
Sorry.

446
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,964
Actually, can we make a stop?

447
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,227
Oh, God.

448
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,344
Hey.

449
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,359
I just wanted to see him
before I went under...

450
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,608
just in case.

451
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,039
Elliott.

452
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,755
Ahhhh.

453
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,998
Go get a cow valve already, will you?

454
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,977
Moo.

455
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,477
I love you guys.

456
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,823
Okay, page me the second
Path has results.

457
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,385
- Hey.
- Hey.

458
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,082
Ohh. I think my
morning sickness has passed.

459
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,350
Ah. My morning sickness
came in the afternoon.

460
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:43,468
- Mm.
- Glad that's over.

461
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:47,253
I'm having the ultrasound
later today, but I'm torn.

462
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,236
A-Are you gonna find out the sex?

463
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:50,498
Nah.

464
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,442
I never understood
the whole gender reveal thing.

465
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,213
I mean, as if you could know
a kid's gender

466
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:56,435
from a blood test.

467
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,796
Well, you can.

468
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,431
You can know the sex, not the gender.

469
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:03,126
Gender is more than just pink
or blue icing in a sheet cake.

470
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,217
Hmm.

471
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,477
You know, in some cultures,
they recognize

472
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,739
as many as six different genders.

473
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,408
Right. So, on your last ultrasound,

474
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,195
you opted not to find out.

475
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,672
I, uh, actually haven't had one yet.

476
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,646
How many weeks are you?

477
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,041
Mm... 20?

478
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:19,257
Amelia Shepherd.

479
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:20,820
You're a doctor.

480
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,416
I know. I should have had one already.

481
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,187
I just am...

482
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,083
...terrified of what I might find out.

483
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,865
I just can't stop thinking, "What if?"

484
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,289
What if it happens again,

485
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:31,615
or w-what if it's something worse?

486
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,838
What if it's an alien? Or a tumor?

487
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,975
What if I am not even pregnant,
I am just a crazy person,

488
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,805
and I just exploded my boyfriend's life

489
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,055
for no reason?

490
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,104
The best way to fight fear
is with information.

491
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:45,235
You can't fix what you don't know.

492
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:48,024
Pregnancy Club just got way less fun.

493
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:50,906
Laurie Reed, return to the admit desk.

494
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,261
Laurie Reed, return to the admit desk.

495
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:00,655
I checked with the mail room.

496
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,461
- No packages for you.
- Thanks.

497
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,468
Didn't realize the residents

498
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:05,332
were also our personal assistants.

499
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,975
I was doing Dr. Grey a favor.

500
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,225
Well, Grey, if you've got errands to run,

501
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,580
I've got this covered.

502
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,538
Look at that.

503
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:14,823
Mass between the 9th and 10th ribs.

504
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,650
That's easily accessible.

505
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,877
Simms, book an OR.

506
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,635
Make sure the lab's ready
to run the biopsy.

507
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,852
But it may not be a tumor.

508
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,622
Well, maybe you haven't
seen many sarcomas.

509
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,601
I've seen everything, thanks.

510
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,344
And I did take out
her gallbladder two years ago,

511
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:31,323
so some gallstones may have spilled

512
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,851
and migrated to her back.

513
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,634
So, your medical opinion is
you did shoddy work?

514
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,766
My medical opinion is

515
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,920
I see no need to worry her mother

516
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:43,177
with talk of tumors or cancer

517
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,452
unless we really need to.

518
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,703
Who are you, exactly?

519
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,995
Meredith Grey.
I'm chief of general surgery.

520
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,323
Oh, Grey. Yeah.

521
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,609
I've heard of you.

522
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:52,930
You're the one who got yourself

523
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,874
and half the staff fired, yeah?

524
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:57,402
Who hired you? Bailey or Koracick?

525
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:58,494
Why?

526
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,300
Bailey usually has too much
sense to hire surgeons

527
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,113
whose egos are too big to fit in an OR.

528
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,579
Let's prep her for a core needle biopsy,

529
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:08,324
and don't say a thing
to her mother about cancer.

530
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,765
Hey, uh, you want a ride to the hospital?

531
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:20,953
Miranda's got an ultrasound,
so I'm taking the afternoon off.

532
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,726
How can a person do this?

533
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,059
I mean, I-I-I thought I would
do this volunteer thing

534
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,517
and understand better,

535
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,260
and maybe I could forgive my mother.

536
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,579
But I can't.

537
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:35,330
I-I... I can't call what she did brave.

538
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,343
I-I can't call it "surrendering."

539
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,989
I...

540
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:45,885
And just looking...
at this tiny, little guy,

541
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,836
I understand even less
how she did what she did.

542
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,325
- Jo, just as a reminder...
- Yeah.

543
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,218
...trauma and... and your brain chemicals

544
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:57,135
c-can prompt a human being
to behave in ways

545
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,246
that people with more
balanced brain chemistry

546
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:02,064
can have a hard time understanding.

547
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:04,633
Right.

548
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,987
Right.

549
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,702
Link thinks this is too much too soon.

550
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:13,777
Let's get this guy to the hospital.

551
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:16,115
You can hand him off
to the social worker there.

552
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,824
We did his physical exam,
and he is all good.

553
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,108
Yeah.

554
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,400
Except for the fact that
his parents don't want him.

555
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,664
No, the people who gave birth
to him don't want him.

556
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,122
His parents...

557
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,602
just haven't met him yet.

558
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:30,942
Okay.

559
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,842
What's the activated clotting time?

560
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:42,065
485 seconds.

561
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,106
Thank you.

562
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,328
You asked that three minutes ago.

563
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:48,185
I know. DeBakey and 15 blade.

564
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:50,558
I was visiting Owen
at Pac North the other day.

565
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,162
Whew! Karev has his work cut out for him.

566
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,933
Mm-hmm. We've got a good plane

567
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,927
between the calcified
and the normal tissue.

568
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,675
Owen's been begging me
to come over there,

569
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,202
fix the cardio department.

570
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:02,251
Apparently, their top surgeon

571
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:05,099
is, like, 200th in the country.

572
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:08,118
I mean, i-it might be a good
opportunity to build a program.

573
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:10,133
Time to separate the valve
from the annulus.

574
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,835
I mean, I'm happy in trauma for now,

575
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,987
and you are doing a terrific job here,

576
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,306
but, God, do I miss this.

577
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,389
Dr. Altman, I asked you to scrub in today

578
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,907
to help speed things along,
not chit-chat.

579
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,956
If you want to go work at Pac
North, go work at Pac North.

580
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,182
Metz.

581
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:29,884
God.

582
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:34,414
You.

583
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,219
Where is Dr. Webber's office?

584
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:38,441
Um, is he expecting you?

585
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:40,351
What is your name?

586
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,260
Z... Zander Perez.

587
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:44,935
Have you heard
of the Catherine Fox Foundation,

588
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,774
Zander Perez?

589
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:47,816
No.

590
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,657
Well, I am Catherine Fox.

591
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:51,219
I own the foundation,

592
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,797
and the foundation owns 30%
of all the hospitals in America.

593
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:55,988
Oh.

594
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,689
Does it own this one?

595
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:00,676
Just show me to his office, son.

596
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,273
Okay. Of course.

597
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:03,523
But, actually, can you wait right here

598
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:04,808
while I page Dr. Webber?

599
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,301
He was having coffee with his wife,

600
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,180
so I don't want to interrupt them.

601
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,552
I am his wife.

602
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,150
Oh.

603
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,411
My.

604
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,460
Um...

605
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:20,108
What are you talking about?
I can't believe...

606
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,505
Parker!

607
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,381
I couldn't stop him.

608
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,152
Mommy, you said I wasn't dying.

609
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:28,446
Okay, honey, stay calm. You're not dying.

610
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,460
I want you to have all
the information as we have it.

611
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,596
No more surprises than
are absolutely necessary.

612
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:34,576
Dr. Grey. So, I know this is scary,

613
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,625
but Jamie has not exhibited any symptoms

614
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,807
that would prompt us to believe

615
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:39,336
this is a worst-case scenario.

616
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,108
So, let's not try to go there.

617
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,435
We'll know more in a few hours.

618
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,728
Mommy, I'm scared.

619
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,125
I know, honey. Me too.

620
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,014
We'll bring her up to the OR shortly.

621
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,808
Is this what you wanted?

622
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,309
This has got nothing to do
with what I want.

623
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:01,110
Am I a terrible mother and a worse doctor

624
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,499
for not getting an ultrasound?

625
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:04,098
You haven't gotten an ultrasound?

626
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:05,280
Okay.

627
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,086
Your question kind of
answers my question.

628
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,324
I just...

629
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,065
You're halfway through the pregnancy.

630
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,399
Don't we want to know
everything there is to know?

631
00:25:15,162 --> 00:25:18,506
He dumped my sister,
and you put him on your service?

632
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,563
Unreal. That...

633
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,647
I did not dump her.

634
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:24,759
You didn't?

635
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,253
No.

636
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:27,699
You want to go clear that up?

637
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,717
She doesn't see me as her equal,

638
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:35,912
so I told her to take some time and...

639
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:37,428
figure out what she wants.

640
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,947
What?

641
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,240
I... I want to be supportive
because I can see you're upset,

642
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:46,811
but, uh... I'm confused.

643
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,416
And she doesn't see you
as her equal 'cause...

644
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:50,591
you're not her equal.

645
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,363
I mean, no offense. Neither am I.

646
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:55,003
I'm great. She's... better.

647
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,413
And you're...

648
00:25:57,011 --> 00:25:58,550
still a resident.

649
00:25:58,575 --> 00:26:00,252
It's just a matter of respect.

650
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:02,128
Yeah, well, my boyfriend isn't my equal.

651
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:03,795
Doesn't mean I don't respect him.

652
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,741
But if he told me to "take some time"...

653
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,550
Yeah, no, I would not respect that.

654
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:15,849
Dude...

655
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:18,015
go get her and undo
whatever it is you did,

656
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,099
because you're not her equal,

657
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:22,288
but she fell in love with you
knowing the facts.

658
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:25,588
But when you try to make
the facts not the facts,

659
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,324
that's how you drive someone crazy.

660
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,157
Valve's in, and we're
almost done closing the aorta.

661
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:34,868
Okay.

662
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,052
Okay, good. Good.

663
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:40,201
- Nice work, Pierce.
- Thank you.

664
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,636
Always heard you were
even better with hearts

665
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,851
than with bloody guts.

666
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,240
Didn't believe it could be true, Altman,

667
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,420
but you proved me wrong.

668
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:46,588
Thank you, Tom.

669
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:51,358
Why don't you just tell him
to leave you alone?

670
00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:52,539
He's my boss.

671
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:54,483
And I broke his heart, and I feel guilty.

672
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:57,088
Wow. So many lawsuits in one explanation.

673
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,893
He's fine. He's harmless.
And we're friends.

674
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,143
Does he know that?

675
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,297
'Cause he seems to think
that he has a future with you,

676
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,531
and you don't seem to be
interested in clearing that up.

677
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,246
Okay. Clamps off.

678
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,808
Let's take the patient off bypass.

679
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:12,204
Dr. Altman, they need you in the pit.

680
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:13,454
You're good to close, yeah?

681
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,051
Yes. Thank you for the assist.

682
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,253
Mm-hmm.

683
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,844
Dr. Pierce? Uh, since I was the one

684
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,371
who was supposed to be
on your service today,

685
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:22,165
do you think I could close?

686
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:26,969
Dr. Pierce?

687
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:29,040
Shut up. Shut up. Um...

688
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:33,115
Shouldn't his heart be restarting by now?

689
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,719
I don't know why...
why it isn't restarting.

690
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:37,526
Why isn't it restarting?

691
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,335
What is it?

692
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:47,828
Lymphoma?

693
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,170
I thought I was out of the woods.

694
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:54,715
Listen, uh, the good news is

695
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,627
treatment options
are fairly straightforward.

696
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,704
I'm not doing chemo.

697
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:59,302
Chemo made me sicker
than cancer ever could.

698
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,430
Okay, Pruitt, testicular lymphoma

699
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,993
is extremely aggressive.

700
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,043
We're talking less than six months

701
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,502
before it gets to the lungs.

702
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,025
Dr. Bailey, you're bleeding.

703
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:21,140
Thank you again for today.

704
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,782
You want me to wait until
the social worker shows up?

705
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,657
No. I'm good.

706
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:31,279
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

707
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:33,641
I got to...

708
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,545
Charge to 30.

709
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,420
Come on, Elliott. Come on.

710
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:44,680
Clear.

711
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:47,111
God. This can't be happening.

712
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,606
This can't be happening again!

713
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:49,995
Should we try e-epi and milrinone?

714
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,462
We've already dosed him twice.

715
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:52,921
Increase the flow on the pump.

716
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:54,415
You're just gonna keep him on bypass?

717
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,352
Helm, I said shut up.

718
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:57,554
What the hell happened?

719
00:28:57,579 --> 00:28:58,923
- Pierce?
- His heart didn't restart.

720
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,244
I don't know what I did.

721
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,640
He's been on bypass
multiple times before, right?

722
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:04,795
It's probably hibernating myocardium.

723
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,547
Let's keep him up here
for a couple hours.

724
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:07,903
It could come back.

725
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:10,390
Pierce, do you agree
with my recommendation?

726
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:12,579
Pierce.

727
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,067
Well, I'm not gonna...

728
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,324
I'm not gonna go out there
and tell his wife and newborn

729
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:20,505
that he's dead,

730
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,657
so I guess I don't have a choice.

731
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,386
Pack the chest. Keep him on bypass.

732
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,914
I'm gonna scrub in.

733
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:44,020
You're just gonna have to wait now.

734
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,559
What happened?

735
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:52,531
Miranda?

736
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,248
Outside if you need me.

737
00:29:56,273 --> 00:29:58,572
I'm so sorry.

738
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,091
Dr. Grey, we have
an update on that package

739
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:38,099
- you were looking for.
- Great.

740
00:30:38,124 --> 00:30:39,802
They haven't found it yet.

741
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:40,949
Any word from the lab?

742
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,061
How's that core biopsy?

743
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:43,277
Pathology's saying they're just seeing

744
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,292
inflammatory cells
and cholesterol deposits.

745
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,473
No malignancy at all?

746
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,037
- No.
- Okay. Scalpel.

747
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:49,218
What are you doing?

748
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:50,331
I'm gonna take this whole thing out,

749
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:51,547
and see what the hell it is.

750
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,833
Dr. Grey, I didn't okay this.

751
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:55,646
Listen, Dr. Whoever You Are,
this is my house.

752
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:56,967
You're a guest in my home.

753
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:58,218
I got this.

754
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:02,838
Bovie.

755
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,145
So, what do you think?

756
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,819
Should I call Seattle Pres and gloat?

757
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:13,312
I don't know.

758
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:17,270
Pools of blood notwithstanding,
you are pretty impressive.

759
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,972
I got some options to consider.

760
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:20,881
Well, please think about it.

761
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,118
Okay.

762
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:29,865
Okay. What?

763
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,948
Just be careful.

764
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:35,351
Take it from me...
that's a slippery slope.

765
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,809
I'm not dead inside, okay?

766
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,170
And I'm very happily taken.

767
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,357
Oh. Did you propose to Teddy?

768
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:42,711
Not yet, but I...

769
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,628
But what? Waiting for her
to have your third child?

770
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:47,642
Dr. Vizant to the cath lab.
Dr. Vizant to the cath lab.

771
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:52,532
Looks like some inflamed tissue.

772
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:54,500
Can I get some light, please?

773
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:10,078
Oh, my God.

774
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,502
Parker, what are we looking at?

775
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:12,789
It looks like...

776
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,099
is that a large gallstone?

777
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,142
It's a large gallstone.

778
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,602
In the posterior chest wall?

779
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:19,104
Her body reacted to it
like it was foreign tissue

780
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,702
and tried to push it out.

781
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,217
Oh, I'm sorry. Do I sound smug?

782
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:25,749
You saw that from a scan?

783
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:28,250
Okay. Let's get some irrigation
and some 2-0 vicryl,

784
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,578
close her up, and get her home.

785
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:37,063
I'll take a veggie burger and
fries, please.

786
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:41,463
You are late.

787
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:43,041
What's that?

788
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:45,599
Uh, gin and... tonic.

789
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,976
Bring us three more.

790
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,026
It's true.

791
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,986
Richard is having an affair.

792
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,383
- How do you know that?
- I saw him.

793
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:03,433
He had her in his office.

794
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,308
You saw Richard having sex
with somebody in his office?

795
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,664
The door was closed,

796
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:10,033
but the intern called her his wife.

797
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:11,909
We used to have sex
all the time in his office.

798
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,473
I don't need... That's...

799
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,851
Okay, look, that sounds like
a miscommunication to me.

800
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,519
Stop defending that man.

801
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:19,308
That man? Mom, we're
talking about Richard.

802
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:21,229
Yes, Richard... who turned his back on me

803
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:23,908
the minute he hit a little career bump.

804
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:25,308
You fired him.

805
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,905
I did no such thing.

806
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:28,190
Bailey fired him.

807
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,996
You could have saved his job,
and you know that.

808
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,565
How dare you accuse me
of not supporting my husband,

809
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:33,919
when you got another little girlfriend

810
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:35,690
before Maggie's body's even cold.

811
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,668
How is that relevant
or any of your business?

812
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:38,999
It's my business

813
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:40,943
when you chose to date
my husband's daughter.

814
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,088
Where are those drinks?!

815
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:43,617
Mom, please, okay?

816
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,831
I cannot be responsible

817
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,707
for my relationships
and yours, all right?

818
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:48,478
There's not enough therapy
in the damn world for that.

819
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:51,592
Tip him.

820
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:58,191
Dr. James to respiratory therapy.

821
00:33:58,216 --> 00:33:59,980
Dr. James to respiratory therapy.

822
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:00,987
Miranda.

823
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:02,134
Uh, I'm fine.

824
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,802
- Let me take you home.
- No.

825
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:05,740
- Come on, Miranda.
- Oh, Ben. Please.

826
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,316
Um... I-I know... I know this
is a-a loss for you, too,

827
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,480
but I'm asking you to just
leave me alone f-for now,

828
00:34:12,504 --> 00:34:15,531
because I can't... I can't feel this now.

829
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,378
I need to change these clothes,
and... and, uh, go to work,

830
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,465
so you need to leave.

831
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,105
Go d-drink with your buddies,
or... or throw things.

832
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,786
Anything but being... here,
looking at me,

833
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:30,086
with those sad, beautiful eyes.

834
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:34,937
Hey!

835
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,188
Did you get that ultrasound?

836
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:37,265
Yes.

837
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,281
Uh, and you should, too.

838
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:40,428
It's important.

839
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,026
I'm gonna go tonight.

840
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:43,143
Good.

841
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,122
Did you decide
if you wanted to know the sex?

842
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:50,645
Yeah. It's a... It's a girl.

843
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,758
Girl!

844
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,611
I don't think I understand.

845
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:11,695
Does he need a new valve?

846
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,050
He just...

847
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:15,029
needs more time.

848
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:16,348
Okay.

849
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:18,986
How much time?

850
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,557
Well, we can't be sure.

851
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:24,195
With hibernating myocardium,

852
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,723
the odds of his heart restarting

853
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,008
are very high.

854
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:29,543
We just don't know how long it'll take.

855
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,648
Wait. You're saying...

856
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:36,140
...it might not start at all?

857
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:38,453
There is a very small chance, but...

858
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,477
No, this has to be a mistake.

859
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,324
He's had this surgery three times before.

860
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:46,068
You've done it three times before.

861
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:47,804
Yes. I have.

862
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:49,673
Then, what happened?

863
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:53,185
I-I... I don't know, Finley.

864
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,679
Oh, my God.

865
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:57,238
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

866
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:06,649
Will you please... Will you excuse me?

867
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:18,807
Pierce.

868
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:20,787
W-What happened in that OR?

869
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,844
I would like to tender my resignation...

870
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:25,616
- effective immediately.
- No, no, h-hang on.

871
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,006
One bad outcome is not...

872
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:29,021
I had a bad feeling. I know that patient.

873
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:32,841
I had a bad feeling.

874
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:35,530
I should have trusted myself.

875
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:38,761
I can't be a surgeon
if I can't trust my own gut.

876
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:39,960
I can't.

877
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,399
I quit.

878
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:44,615
Y...

879
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,117
I seem to be in need of a cardio chief.

880
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:57,741
- Interested?
- What?

881
00:36:57,766 --> 00:37:00,139
Tom, you can't just fire people

882
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,062
to give me what you think I need.

883
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,146
I have... I have moved on.

884
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,127
I love Owen.

885
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:08,141
I am sorry that I hurt you.

886
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,157
I mean, truly sorry.

887
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:13,089
You... You are a wonderful man,

888
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:14,964
and you are gonna make some woman...

889
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:19,306
or several women... incredibly happy.

890
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:20,730
But, uh, you have just...

891
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:24,170
you have got to stop barking
up this particular tree.

892
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:25,852
I-I didn't fire Pierce.

893
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:28,516
She quit.

894
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:29,697
Oh. Oh.

895
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:33,401
But I do think you should be
my cardio chief.

896
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,846
- Okay.
- And, Teddy?

897
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:38,184
Mm-hmm?

898
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,713
I want a life with you.

899
00:37:39,738 --> 00:37:42,770
I'd marry you tomorrow,
right now, if you said yes.

900
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:46,938
Owen has a baby with you,
and he hasn't proposed.

901
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,438
Are you really sure you want to...

902
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,619
close this door?

903
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,211
Well, thank you. Thank you so much.

904
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:34,342
This has been hell.

905
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,256
I can only imagine.

906
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,475
But this is good news, Jamie.

907
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:42,117
You're going to get to go to
your dance zit-hump free.

908
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,482
It doesn't matter.

909
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:45,323
Zachary still hasn't texted me back.

910
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,399
Oh.

911
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,535
What age is this boy? Zachary?

912
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,699
13. My age.

913
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:52,539
Well, as someone who's raised

914
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,928
a couple of 13-year-old boys,

915
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,907
I can tell you two things...

916
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,469
first is, the only
thoughts in their heads

917
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:59,761
are "Fortnite" and pizza.

918
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:02,990
And the second is,
they're terrified of girls,

919
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:06,393
can't talk to them...
especially the ones they like.

920
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,964
Ah.

921
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,679
Catherine's gonna be out of town.

922
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,602
I didn't even know she was in town.

923
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,428
She's thinks there's
something going on between us,

924
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,937
doesn't she?

925
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:34,584
Yes.

926
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

927
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:48,149
How'd it go? How you doing?

928
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:50,372
Thanks for coming over.

929
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,723
Uh-oh.

930
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:52,904
Was I right?

931
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,329
Was it too much too soon?

932
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:55,545
Do we need vodka?

933
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:04,472
One could argue that it was,
in fact, too much too soon.

934
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:18,136
Home means different
things to different people.

935
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:21,275
Sometimes, home is a person.

936
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
_

937
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:28,074
_

938
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,960
So, is your thing
to terrify them for no reason

939
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:36,566
and then bask in the relief?

940
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:39,381
I'm not interested in trying to guess

941
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:41,499
what people want to hear.

942
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,924
I prefer to give them all the information

943
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,455
and let them figure out
how to deal with it.

944
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,990
My wife's doctors didn't pay me
that respect before she died.

945
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:53,756
Listen, Grey, this is your house,

946
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:56,986
but someone gave me a key,
so maybe it's best if we...

947
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,383
try to learn how to live together.

948
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,198
Welcome back, Dr. Grey.

949
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:04,272
_

950
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,270
I can see why you were missed.

951
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,465
_

952
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,503
_

953
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,222
Home can be a feeling.

954
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:24,864
Psychiatrists say,

955
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,740
for those of us who come from
dysfunctional homes...

956
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:28,130
Everything's fine?

957
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,485
Perfectly fine.

958
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,257
...that feeling is chaos.

959
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,073
But...

960
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:37,858
uh, you're not 20 weeks pregnant.

961
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:39,272
I'm not?

962
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:42,317
No. Y-You're 24.

963
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,694
No. That's not possible.

964
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:46,974
No? No.

965
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:48,489
Because that could mean...

966
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,309
Oh, God.

967
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:53,698
No.

968
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,853
We think family means drama.

969
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:06,352
They were awful all day long.

970
00:42:06,377 --> 00:42:09,602
And you promised me a reward.

971
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,755
Food first, then dessert.

972
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,839
I disagree with that order.

973
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,779
My wife miscarried
before Andrea was born.

974
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:28,132
It's painfully common.

975
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:29,175
Captain Herrera...

976
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,211
Got it. Shutting up.

977
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,550
Why were you at the hospital?

978
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,855
So is no wonder why so many of us

979
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:41,855
from broken homes

980
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:54,447
Drives on pain and destruction.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
